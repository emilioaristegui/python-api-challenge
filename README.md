# python-api-challenge

## Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

## Part 1: WeatherPy" are the following
- Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude.
- Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the started code. 
- Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Temperature. 
- Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Humidity.
- Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Cloudiness. 
- Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Wind Speed. 
- Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship. 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude.
- Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude. 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude. 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude. 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude. 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude. 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude. 
- Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude. 

## Part 2: VacationPy" are the following
- Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame. 
- Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition.
- For each city in the hotel_df DataFrame, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates. 
- Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map.
